# my neovim config

you probably don't need this. unless you want to STEAL *MY* configuration (evil)

## setup

1. install neovim
2. `git clone https://github.com/nasso/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim`
3. run `nvim` to let it install all the plugins and stuff
4. restart it because it will probably need to restart after installing all the
   plugins and stuff

> note that the path is probably different on wind\*ws but i don't care about
> that "operating system"
